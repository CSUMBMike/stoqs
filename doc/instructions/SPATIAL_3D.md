Instructions for creating terrain files for 3D spatial data visualization in STOQS
==================================================================================

### GeoElevationGrid

1. Execute script in `mapping@elvis:/mbari/TerrainData/scripts` to create .wrl or .x3dv file
2. Edit resulting file keeping heights and making it X3D:

```
<scene>
<shape>
    <Appearance>
        <Material diffuseColor='0.7 0.7 0.7'/>
    </Appearance>
    <GeoElevationGrid colorPerVertex='true' creaseAngle='3.14' geoGridOrigin='36 -122 0' geoSystem='"GD" "WE"' solid='false' xDimension='1438' xSpacing='0.0005057477' yScale='10' zDimension='1224' zSpacing='0.0005058092' normalPerVertex='true' ccw='true' containerField='geometry' height='-2403.4 ....'>
    </GeoElevationGrid>
</shape>
</scene>
```


### X3DOM popGeometry or SRC from a GMT .grd file

1. Start with a GMT .grd bathymetry file such as that produced by an `mbgrid(1)` execution

2. Convert to an xyz .asc "point cloud", apply 10x vertical exaggeration, convert to Earth Centered Earth Fixed coordinate system, e.g.:

   a. Geocentric - no GeoOrigin:

        grd2xyz Monterey25.grd --FORMAT_FLOAT_OUT=%f | sed '/NaN/d' | awk '{print $1, $2, 10 * $3}' | mapproject -E > Monterey25_10x.asc

   b. With a GeoOrigin:

        echo -121 36 0 | mapproject -E --D_FORMAT=%f      # -2660686.065357 -4428125.227549 3728191.675831
        grd2xyz MontereyCanyonBeds_1m+5m.grd --D_FORMAT=%f | sed '/NaN/d' | awk '{print $1, $2, 10 * $3}' | mapproject -E --D_FORMAT=%f | \
          awk '{print $1 - -2660686.065357, $2 - -4428125.227549, $3 - 3728191.675831}' > MontereyCanyonBeds_1m+5m_10x_GeoOrigin_-121_36_0.asc

3. Use Meshlab to construct a surface from the .asc file and save it as a Stanford .ply file.  You need to use Meshlab interactively
   to load the .asc mesh, construct Normals and a surface, and clean it up before saving as a .ply or .x3d file.  Here are the
   suggested steps relevent to Meshlab_64bit v1.3.3 on a Mac:

        Copy Monterey25_10x.asc (e.g.) file locally to machine that has Meshlab
    	File -> Import Mesh...
        Filters -> Point Sets -> Compute normals for point sets (defaults)
        Filters -> Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction -> 
                   Surface Reconstruction: Poisson (Octree Depth: 12, Solver Divide: 10)
	    Filters -> Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction -> Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation:
		    - Target number of faces: 1,500,000
		    - Preserve Normal
		    - Preseve Topology
		    - Optimal Position of Simplified Vertices
		    - Planar Simplification
		    - Post-simplification cleaning
	    Filters -> Normals, Curvatures and Orientation -> Invert Faces Orientation (if needed)
        * Cleanup - use editing tools (with plenty of intermediate saves)
        Filters -> Smoothing, Fairing and Deformation -> Laplacian smooth (surface preserve)
        File -> Export Mesh As... (save as file Monterey25_10x-clean.ply)

   There are several good Meshlab video tutorials online that will help you understand how to use the UI.

   Here is another Meshlab set of operations that rendered a high quality mesh for 1m+5m bathymetry data for Monterey Canyon:

        Load .asc file
        Sampling -> Poisson-disk Sampling (to reduce number of vertices from 49,879,075 to 20,000,000)
        Point Sets -> Compute normals for point sets
        Surface Reconstruction: Poisson (Octree Depth: 12, Solver Divide: 10)
        Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction -> Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation:
                - Preserve Normal
                - Preseve Topology
                - Optimal Position of Simplified Vertices
                - Planar Simplification
                - Post-simplification cleaning
        Cleanup (with plenty of intermediate saves)
        Smoothing ... -> Laplacian smooth (surface preserve)
        Export mesh to .ply

4. Use InstantReality aopt tool to "flatten" the Scene and create popGeometry, e.g.:

        mkdir /Users/mccann/Downloads/binGeo -or- remove files in /Users/mccann/Downloads/binGeo
        ./aopt -i /Users/mccann/Downloads/Monterey25_10x-clean.ply -F Scene -b /Users/mccann/Downloads/Monterey25_10x-opt.x3db
        ./aopt -i /Users/mccann/Downloads/Monterey25_10x-opt.x3db -f PrimitiveSet:creaseAngle:4 -V -K "/Users/mccann/Downloads/binGeo/:ib" -N /Users/mccann/Downloads/Monterey25_10x.html

5. Copy the X3D `<scene>` element and its contents from the generated .html file into a .x3d file and put it along with the the associated files 
   in binGeo to the stoqs/static/x3d directory.  Replace the paths to the binGeo files with what works on the stoqs server, e.g.:

        :%s#/Users/mccann/Downloads/binGeo#/stoqs/static/x3d/Monterey25/binGeo#g

6. Test that the STOQS UI displays the new mesh in the Spatial -> 3D tab.

7. With X3DOM 1.6 and later and at least aopt V2.6.0 we can generate more efficient SRC instead of popGeometry:

        cd /Users/mccann/Downloads/
        aopt -i Monterey25_10x-clean.ply -F Scene -b Monterey25_10x-opt.x3db
        aopt -i Monterey25_10x-opt.x3db -f PrimitiveSet:creaseAngle:4 -V -Y "nodeType(Geometry)" -N Monterey25_10x_src.html

    Edit `Monterey25_10x_src.html`:

    - Add `'SRC/'` to the url path for the `.src` files.

    - Change aopt's `<material>` node from:
        ```
        <material diffuseColor='0.6 0.6 0.6' specularColor='0.6 0.6 0.6'></material>
        ```
      to:
        ```
        <material diffuseColor='0.7 0.7 0.7' specularColor='0.1 0.1 0.1'></material>
        ```

    Copy `Monterey25_10x_src.html` to `Monterey25_10x_src_scene.x3d` and edit:

    - Remove surrounding elements from the `<scene>` tags
    - Edit in the FQDN for the urls so that Django will load it.
    - Remove `<viewpoint>` node that aopt added, if `-V` option was used
